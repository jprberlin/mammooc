You\'ll be prepared for intermediate-level computer science classes when you\'ve mastered the concepts covered in this course.\n\n###Build a Search Engine\nThroughout this course, you\'ll build a search engine by learning about and producing key search engine components including a crawler, an index and a page rank algorithm. As you build these pieces, you\'ll be learning about and practicing computer science skills that will ready you for intermediate level computer science courses. \n\n###Build a Social Network\nAt the end of the course we will give you a set of relationships (i.e. strings of phrases like \u201cDave likes Andy, Kathleen and Kristy\u201d) and you will use your new computer science skills to organize these relationships into a social network. With your new social network, you can explore relationships and gain insight into how you fit into your own social networks.", "featured": false, "teaser_video": {"youtube_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm_WAWZNbdA"}, "title": "Intro to Computer Science", "required_knowledge": "There is no prior computer programming knowledge needed for this course.

You can begin whenever you like and then follow your own pace. It\'s a good idea to set goals for yourself to make sure you stick with the course.\n\n### How long will the course be available?\n\nThis class will always be available! \n\n### How do I know if this course is for me?\n\n Take a look at the \u201cClass Summary,\u201d \u201cWhat Should I Know,\u201d and \u201cWhat Will I Learn\u201d sections above. If you want to know more, just enroll in the course and start exploring.\n\n### Can I skip individual videos? What about entire lessons?\n\n Yes! The point is for you to learn what YOU need (or want) to learn. If you already know something, feel free to skip ahead. If you ever find that you\'re confused, you can always go back and watch something that you skipped.\n\n### What are the rules on collaboration?\n\n Collaboration is a great way to learn. You should do it! The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them. \n\n### Why are there so many questions?\n\n Udacity classes are a little different from traditional courses. We intersperse our video segments with interactive questions. There are many reasons for including these questions: to get you thinking, to check your understanding, for fun, etc... But really, they are there to help you learn. They are NOT there to evaluate your intelligence, so try not to let them stress you out.\n\n### What should I do while I\'m watching the videos?\n\n Learn actively! You will retain more of what you learn if you take notes, draw diagrams, make notecards, and actively try to make sense of the material.", "affiliates": [], "tracks": ["Data Science", "Web Development", "Software Engineering"], "banner_image": "https://lh5.ggpht.com/UCA7Y75zHA5jwS9o5dmeAn8TlBiTZZbFQZ3ktLaVnfgSHNELh1rquY1dbzOB6BaYyXP0UMNNazdauW_g1w=s0#w=4680&h=968", "short_summary": "Learn key computer science concepts in this introductory Python course.
