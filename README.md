## How To Contribute
We are happy about everyone who contributes to mammooc!
Here is a little guide to simplify contributing: 

1. Fork the Repository 
2. Implement a new feature or fix a bug (have a look at our [Issues](https://github.com/mammooc/mammooc.org/issues))
3. Add tests for your code
 - we use rspec for model and controller tests
 - for our feature tests we use capybara (with selenium)
 - You can find all tests in the spec directory
 - To run all tests: ```bundle exec rspec```
4. Create Pull request
 - if your request gets two times a +1, we will merge your request 

If you want to do a perfect job:
- have a look at our [Code Style Guideline](Code Style Guidelines)
- we use rubocop to automatically correct the code: ```rake rubocop:run``` 

How you run the application on localhost:

1. please have a look at our environment variables below
 - some of them are marked as necessary, these have to be set for running the application
2. we use passenger as application server
 - to start the application: ```passenger start```
 - the application is available at: ```localhost:3000``` 
 - stop the application: ```passenger stop```

If you want to test out stuff feel free to use our dev deployment (so you don't polute the production data):
- Our dev-branch is deployed under: https://mammooc-dev.herokuapp.com/
- Username: ```max@example.com``` or ```maxi@example.com```
- Password: ```12345678```
- the database will be reset after each deployment  

For any questions:

1. open a new issue
2. add the label 'question'
3. Write down your question
4. we will answer as soon as possible :)
